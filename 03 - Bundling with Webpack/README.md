# Bundler and Webpack

- Why we use bundlers to merge all required files into a single JS file
- We need to lower the latency of HTTP requests as much as possible using the bundler
- We use webpack to integrate our codes and serve it wherever we want
- Using the command `npm run build`, webpack starts to gather required files and provide a stable webpage
- Using the command `npm run watch:build`, webpack watches the changes to regenerate modules.
